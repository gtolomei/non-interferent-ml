# Nostro algo

- OK (regression?)

# SVM

- ok (check tuning dei parametri)

# Adv. Boosting

- True implementation
  - LightGBM (scikit learn)
  - Loop: attack & train
    - generate attacked datasets
    - continue training from previous forest with new data

# Threat model

- introduce budget limitations (impacts on attacks generation)


# Datasets and settings

- targeted attacks
- wine dataset
 - multiclass instead of binary vs. regression ?
